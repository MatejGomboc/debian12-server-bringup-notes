Looking at your GRUB configuration file, I can see that you already have GRUB_TIMEOUT=5 set, which should make the GRUB menu automatically boot the default option (typically Debian) after 5 seconds. The fact that this isn't happening suggests there could be another issue interfering with the timeout functionality.
Let's try a few adjustments to ensure the timeout works correctly:

First, let's add a timeout style setting. This explicitly tells GRUB how to handle the timeout:

GRUB_TIMEOUT_STYLE=countdown
Add this line right after the GRUB_TIMEOUT=5 line. This will display a countdown rather than silently waiting, which helps confirm the timeout is working.

If you want the menu to not appear at all (unless you press Shift during boot), you could set:

GRUB_TIMEOUT_STYLE=hidden
GRUB_TIMEOUT=0

Sometimes the GRUB recordfail mechanism can cause the timeout to be ignored if it detects a previous failed boot. You might want to add:

GRUB_RECORDFAIL_TIMEOUT=5
This ensures that even if GRUB detects a previous failed boot, it will still timeout after 5 seconds.

After making these changes, save the file and run:

sudo update-grub

Then reboot your system to test if the timeout now works.

If the timeout still doesn't work after these changes, there might be an issue with the GRUB installation itself. In that case, you could try reinstalling the GRUB bootloader:
sudo grub-install /dev/sda
(Replace /dev/sda with your actual boot device if different)
Another possibility is that there's a stuck key on your keyboard (or a malfunctioning keyboard) that's causing GRUB to think you're interacting with it, which pauses the timeout. Try disconnecting any external keyboards or checking for stuck keys if the problem persists.
