# Understanding and Solving Your Sudoers Issue in Debian 12

The error message you're seeing indicates that your user account (`admin-user`) doesn't have permission to use the `sudo` command. This is a common issue after a fresh installation when the account wasn't properly set up with administrative privileges.

## What's Happening?

In Linux systems, the "sudoers file" controls which users can execute commands with elevated privileges (as the superuser or root). Your account isn't listed in this file, so you can't use `sudo`.

## How to Fix This

Since you can't use `sudo` yet, you'll need to use the root account to fix this. Here's a step-by-step approach:

### Method 1: Using the Root Account

1. First, switch to the root user by logging in as root:
   ```
   su -
   ```
   You'll be prompted for the root password.

2. Once logged in as root, add your user to the sudo group:
   ```
   usermod -aG sudo admin-user
   ```

3. Alternatively, you can edit the sudoers file directly:
   ```
   apt install sudo   # If sudo isn't installed yet
   EDITOR=nano visudo
   ```

4. Add this line at the end of the file:
   ```
   admin-user ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
   ```

5. Save and exit (in nano: Ctrl+O, Enter, then Ctrl+X)

6. Log out of the root account:
   ```
   exit
   ```

7. Log out and back in with your user account for the changes to take effect, or run:
   ```
   newgrp sudo
   ```

## Why Did This Happen?

During Debian installation, the first user created is typically added to the sudo group automatically. This might not have happened in your case for a few reasons:

- You may have selected a non-standard installation option
- You might have created this user after installation
- There might have been an oversight during the installation process

## Verification

After following these steps, you can verify that it worked by running:
```
sudo apt update
```

If it executes without errors, you've successfully fixed the issue!

Would you like me to explain any part of this process in more detail?
